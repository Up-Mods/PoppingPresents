# Popping Presents
Find presents littered around the world, open them for a chance to find tools and sometimes rare resources.

Randomly spawning around the world, Popping Presents can be harvested for tools and resources, however, should you take everything you get a litle surprise as a reward!

There are four presents to be found, each offering more rewards the larger they get, should you wish to add more you can do so with datapacks!
